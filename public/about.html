  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Ege. I’m 17 years old and I live in Turkey. I’ve always been curious about technology, and over time I found myself especially interested in programming and web development.</p>

  <p>I’m still at the very beginning of my journey, learning step by step. Right now, I’m building small projects to practice what I’ve learned so far. It’s exciting to see how a few lines of code can turn into something real on the screen.</p>

  <p>For me, programming is more of a hobby than a career plan at the moment. I enjoy experimenting, making mistakes, and figuring out how things work. My main goal is to keep improving and one day turn this passion into something bigger.</p>
